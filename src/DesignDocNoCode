LinearEquation class

Instance Variables:
private int x = This represents the x-coordinate
private int y = This represents the y-coordinate

Constructor
public LinearEquation(String firstXY, String secondXY)

Methods
public String noncat = Seperates the x and y into two different Strings
public String concat = Concatenates two strings together
public int toInt = This will convert the seperated String values of x and y to integers using Integer.parseInt()
public String equation = This will be the equation of the line that goes through both points
public double slope = This will calcualte the slope of the line
public double yIntercept = This calculates the y-intercept of the line of the two original points
public double yDiff = This will do y2 - y1, or the distance between the y-coordinates
public double xDiff = This will do x2 - x1, or the distance between the x-coordinates

Step 1: Import Scanner class
Step 2: Ask user for first x,y corrdinate and store as String firstXY
Step 3: Ask user for second x,y coordinate and store as String sceondXY
Step 4: Call noncat, toInt
Step 5: Use new int values of x1,y1,x2,y2 to call and solve equation,slope,yIntercept,and xDiff and yDiff
Step 6: Print resulting values
